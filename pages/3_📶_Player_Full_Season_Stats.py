    This is the glossary for some of the metrics used in this analysis:

    - **Overrun**: Heavy touch in a dribble.
    - **Progressive Passes**: A pass that moves the ball closer to the opponent goal by 25% & at least 5 m vertically.
    - **Second Assist** : The last action of a player from the goalscoring team, prior to an Assist by a teammate.
    - **Lay-off** : A pass by a striker who has received the ball with his back to goal and is played back towards team-mates.
    - **Dispossessed** : Player is dispossessed on the ball by an opponent â€“ no dribble involved.
    - **GK Distribution** : Actions where the goalkeeper successfully distributes the ball to a teammate.
    - **GK Launches**  : long balls launched forward into an area of the pitch rather than to a specific team-mate.
    - **Other Goals** : Goals scored using any body part other than the right foot, left foot, or the head.
